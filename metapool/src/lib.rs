impl MetaPool {
    /* NOTE
    This contract implements several traits

    1. core-contracts/staking-pool: this contract must be perceived as a staking-pool for the lockup-contract, wallets, and users.
        This means implementing: ping, deposit, deposit_and_stake, withdraw_all, withdraw, stake_all, stake, unstake_all, unstake
        and view methods: get_account_unstaked_balance, get_account_staked_balance, get_account_total_balance, is_account_unstaked_balance_available,
            get_total_staked_balance, get_owner_id, get_reward_fee_fraction, is_staking_paused, get_staking_key, get_account,
            get_number_of_accounts, get_accounts.

    2. meta-staking: these are the extensions to the standard staking pool (liquid_unstake, trip-meter)

    3. fungible token [NEP-141]: this contract is the NEP-141 contract for the stNEAR token

    4. multi fungible token [NEP-138]: this contract works as a multi-token also to allow access to the $META governance token
